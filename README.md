Product Description and Review Analysis using NLP

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing e-commerce product descriptions and customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to enhance the understanding and presentation of product features by summarizing product descriptions, extracting relevant keywords, and classifying customer reviews for sentiment analysis. This can help businesses improve product discovery and customer experience on e-commerce platforms.

Features:
Product Description Analysis: Automatically processes product descriptions to highlight key features.
Customer Review Analysis: Analyzes customer reviews to identify sentiment (positive/negative), trends, and potential areas for improvement.
Text Summarization: Extracts concise and relevant key product features from lengthy descriptions.
Feature Extraction: Uses techniques like TF-IDF and POS tagging to identify the most important features in product descriptions.
Sentiment Classification: Applies machine learning models to classify customer reviews and predict their sentiment.
Visualization: Creates word clouds and other visualizations to represent key terms and insights.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis is the Amazon Product Dataset, which includes the following columns:

Product_name: Name of the product.
by_info: Brand of the product.
Product_url: URL link to the product page on Amazon.
Product_img: URL link to the product image.
Product_price: Price of the product.
rating: Rating of the product (out of 5 stars).
total_review: Total number of customer reviews.
ans_ask: Number of answered questions about the product.
prod_des: Product description.
feature: Key features of the product.
cust_review: Customer reviews (feedback provided by customers).
This dataset allows for comprehensive analysis of product descriptions and customer sentiments, making it a valuable resource for improving product listings and understanding customer behavior.

Dependencies:
Python 3
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
wordcloud
textblob

Setup:
Clone this repository or download the notebook file.

Install the necessary dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib wordcloud textblob
Run the Jupyter notebook (PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION_AND_REVIEW_ANALYSIS.ipynb) to start the analysis process.

Usage:
The notebook includes the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal).
Text Feature Extraction: Applying TF-IDF and POS tagging to extract key features.
Sentiment Analysis: Using machine learning models to classify customer reviews as positive or negative.
Visualization: Generating word clouds and plotting key terms.

Results:
The project outputs visualizations, such as word clouds, and statistical reports, including classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

Future Work:
Voice-Activated Search Optimization: Adapt product descriptions for better compatibility with voice search systems.
Multimodal Data Integration: Combine textual data with images and videos for a richer, more detailed analysis.
Cross-Language Support: Expand the model to support multiple languages, enabling the analysis of global e-commerce platforms.
